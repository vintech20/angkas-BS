- git init = This initializes the git repository  
- .git = This is the git LocalRepo 
- git status = Check the status of git / Used to track files location
- Once a repository is initialised with <git init> then that repository is in the 
  working area      
- git clone <URL> = Clone the GitHub URL from the RemoteRepo to LocalRepo 
- git add <name of file> = Move the file from the Working area to the Staging area
- git add . = Move everything from the Working Area to the Staging
- git commit (git commit -m "") = Move the code from the staging area to the 
  Production area (ready to push to GitHub)  
  However to do this we need to configure our credentials so that the LocalRepo 
  can communicate with the RemoteRepo.
